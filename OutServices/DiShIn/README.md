# DiShIn: Semantic Similarity Measures using Disjunctive Shared Information

This software package provides the basic functions to start using semantic similarity measures directly from a rdf or owl file. 

- semanticbase.py : provides a function to produce the semantic-base as a SQLite database 

- ssm.py : provides the functions to calculate semantic similarity based on teh SQLite database

- metals.py : provides examples of semantric similarity for the metals.owl 

- chebi.py : provides examples for the ChEBI ontology; OWL file:  ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chebi/ontology/

- go.py : provides examples for the Gene Ontology (GO) ontology; OWL file: http://geneontology.org/page/download-ontology#go.obo_and_go.owl; Annotation files (extrinsic): http://www.geneontology.org/page/download-annotations

- hpo.py : provides examples for the Human Phenotype ontology (HPO); OWL file: http://human-phenotype-ontology.github.io/downloads.html

- wordnet.py : provides examples for the WordNet; OWL file: http://www.w3.org/2006/03/wn/wn20/rdf/wordnet-hyponym.rdf

Notice that we should comment the semanticbase.create call after the .db file has been created, and only uncomment it when a new version of the owl file is available.

A web tool using this package is available at: http://labs.fc.ul.pt/dishin/
